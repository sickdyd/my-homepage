          During 2023/2024, we completed the installation of several
          self-managed Kubernetes clusters worldwide. We decided to migrate the
          provisioning of the test environment VMs to our new clusters, with the
          aim of reducing our GCP bill to zero. I was tasked with leading the
          migration project.
